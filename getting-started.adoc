= Getting Started with Raincatcher

== Overview

Raincatcher is a set of templates and a field workforce management (WFM) application that connects a business' back-office with its fleet of mobilized employees.  Raincatcher leverages mobile hardware, making use of each employee's mobile phone.

Raincatcher consists of a set of reusable modules that can be included in your application using http://browserify.org/[browserify]. 


Raincatcher modules make use of the
https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/[mediator pattern] to enable
loose coupling between the Raincatcher modules and their consuming
applications / modules as shown in the following diagram:

== Raincatcher Structure

Raincatcher modules are packaged and distributed using https://www.npmjs.com/[npm] and export as:

* Angular.js directives or services providing client-side functionality for both the mobile and portal clients.
* Express.js routes providing a REST API to be consumed by the
client-side portions of the module.
* FeedHenry sync configurations which enable data synchronization of  module data.

A demonstration is also provided as a project template that shows how the modules can be assembled into an application. See link:The link:demo-solution-architecture.adoc[Demo Solution Architecture] for more information.
