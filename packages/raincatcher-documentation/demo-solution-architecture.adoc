[[overview]]
== Overview

The Raincatcher demo solution shows how a combination of 
Raincatcher modules can be used to produce a workforce management solution.

The Raincatcher demo solution is intended to be a reference
implementation of a workforce management solution. This solution
contains modules that are related specifically to Red Hat Mobile
Application Platform features, and is therefore currently only
functional with access to an RHMAP platform instance.

Some examples of RHMAP specific modules include:

* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-push[raincatcher-push]
module uses the Aerogear Push API to send push notifications.
* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-sync[raincatcher-sync]
module uses Client and Cloud APIs specific to the RHMAP Sync framework.
* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-user[raincatcher-user]
modules uses RHMAP Auth Policies to validate users.


[[what-is-a-raincatcher-module]]
== What Is A Raincatcher Module?

Before describing the demo solution, it is necessary to introduce the
concept of a Raincatcher module.

There are several important concepts that the Raincatcher modules
exploit to work correctly:

* The Raincatcher Mediator
* The Raincatcher Module User Interface
* Bridging The Mediator Events Between Client And Cloud

To illustrate these concepts, there is a smaller tutorial solution that
incorporates:

* https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-tutorial-module[A
simple Raincatcher module].
* https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-tutorial-client[A
simple Client App incorporating the Raincatcher module]
* https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-tutorial-cloud[A
simple Cloud App incorporating the Raincatcher module]

You can clone these repositories and run them locally to see the
Raincatcher module bridging functionality. It is recommended that you
become familiar with this simpler solution to get a good understanding
of Raincatcher concepts before attempting to

[[raincatcher-mediator]]
== Raincatcher Mediator

In the Raincatcher project, the
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-mediator/blob/master/README.md[Raincatcher
mediator] module is a module implementing the mediator pattern. All
Raincatcher modules must publish and subscribe to the same mediator in
order to communicate.

In the next section, the naming conventions for how Raincatcher modules
communicate are described.

[[mediator-pattern-namespacing]]
=== Mediator Pattern Namespacing

In the Raincatcher project, all modules can subscribe and publish
messages to the mediator. In order to differentiate between mediator
events between topics, it is necessary to namespace the messages that
are published.

Topics in Raincatcher are defined as text fields separated by a __:__, for example, ``wfm:user:list``. Raincatcher topics are prefixed with _wfm_ by
convention.

Topics can have a state prefix that defines the result of a topic.

* _done_ : The `done` state defines a topic that has executed
successfully, for example, ``done:wfm:user:list``
* _error_ : The `error` state defines a topic that has encountered an
error when executing, for example, ``error:wfm:user:list``

[[raincatcher-module-user-interface]]
== Raincatcher Module User Interface

Raincatcher modules use the https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS 1]
framework to enable Raincatcher modules to have their own user
interface. Having this separation of UI and business logic allows the
modules to maintain their loose coupling.

Raincatcher modules define the UI functionality in the `angular` folder
of each module. Each module is exported as an AngularJS module, for example, 
``wfm.user`` is the AngularJS module name for the
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-user/blob/master/lib/angular/user-ng.js[Raincatcher
User] module.

Currently, AngularJS 1 is the only UI framework implemented into the
Raincatcher modules.

[[bridging-the-mediator-events-between-client-and-cloud]]
== Bridging The Mediator Events Between Client And Cloud

One of the main concepts in the Raincatcher modules is the bridging of
mediator events between the client and cloud in the same module. This allows client topics to propagate to the cloud and from the cloud to the client. Any other dependent modules on the cloud can then subscribe to the event for further processing on the cloud side.

image:assets/images/mobile-bridging.png[Illustration Of Bridging Between
Client and Cloud In Raincatcher Modules]

This diagram shows how the client and cloud apps
have a similar structure. The same Raincatcher modules are added as
dependencies in both the client and cloud apps. All of code required for both
client and cloud functionality is contained in the same module.

From the point of view of the application developer, the mechanism for
bridging the client/cloud divide is abstracted by the Raincatcher
module.
  
[NOTE]
--
Not all Raincatcher modules propagate topics between
client and cloud. For example, the
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-camera[raincatcher-camera]
module only has a client side component. However, it is possible to customize this module to automatically forward photos to a server.
--

Example modules include:

* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-user[raincatcher-user]
module uses HTTP requests to send topics to the cloud endpoints, the communication is client-cloud only.
* The
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-workorder[raincatcher-workorder]
module uses the
https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-sync[raincatcher-sync]
module. The _raincatcher-sync_ module provides a mechanism to have
two-way client-cloud topic propagation.
